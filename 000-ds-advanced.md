### Priority Queue

* Like an dictionary (with key, value)
* Ordered by key
* Main operations include `insert()`, `min()`, `removeMin()`

**Binary Heap - An Implementation of Priority Queue**

>  A **binary heap** is a complete binary tree whose entries satisfy the **heap-order property**: no child has a key less than its parent's key (all children's key are greater than their parents). Observe that every subtree of a binary heap is also a binary heap, because every subtree is complete and satisfies the heap-order property.

* What is the data structure to represent the heap?
* How to implement each operation?
  * What are the complexity?
* How about heap construction?
